# **Algorithmic Image Processing & Compression in C++**  

## **Overview**  
This project explores efficient image manipulation techniques using advanced data structures and algorithms in C++. It focuses on **image compression, flood fill recoloring, and optimized pixel storage**, applying **doubly-linked lists, partition trees (PTrees), and graph traversal algorithms (BFS/DFS)** for improved performance and memory efficiency.  

## **Features**  
- **Image Compression with Doubly-Linked Lists**  
  - Represented PNG images using **doubly-linked lists**, allowing efficient manipulation of pixel data.  
  - Enabled structured image storage for optimized memory management.  

- **Flood Fill Algorithm for Image Manipulation**  
  - Implemented **flood fill** using **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** and **Depth-First Search (DFS)** to change pixel colors dynamically.  
  - Optimized traversal strategies for large-scale image recoloring.  

- **PTree-Based Image Compression**  
  - Compressed images by up to **89%** while preserving critical details.  
  - Used **partition trees (PTrees)** to store hierarchical representations of images, reducing storage requirements.  

## **Technologies Used**  
- **C++** - Core programming language for algorithmic implementation.  
- **Doubly-Linked Lists** - Structured storage for image pixel data.  
- **Graph Search Algorithms** - BFS and DFS for optimized flood fill operations.  
- **Partition Trees (PTrees)** - Efficient hierarchical compression for large images.
